					<h1>Welcome to PHPDoc!</h1>
				
					PHPDoc currently requires a late PHP4 version (4.0.3dev) to work.
					Some earlier version like to crash with memory trouble. 
					<p>
					PHPDoc was programmed without	using PHP4 features that means 
					it will run with version prior to	4.0.3dev on fine day. 
					But again: my PHP3.0.15 crashed when it started to render the 
					HTML documents :(.
					<p>
					I'll try to provide a solution as soon as possible.

					<h2>Finished!</h2>
					PHPDoc has finished his work. The generated XML and HTML files can be found in
					the directory specified with setTarget() in the above code. This is per default "installationdir/apidoc/".
					Within this directory is another directory named "keep/". It contains a stylesheet file and 
					a frameset you can use to browse the HTML files. 
					<p>
					Don't be disappointed if PHPDoc makes documentation mistakes. Always remember it's currently
					only grabbing not parsing. If PHPDoc will develop as a standard this will change as soon 
					as possible. Please be patient and wait until "... later this year." ;-).
					<p>
					Have fun!
